		<p>
			Foamy Panda Creations is a Canterbury based web development company founded by Lee Walker in 2013 while he was 
			taking is undergaduate degree in computer science at the University of Kent. During this time he developed
			a keen interest in the various aspects of web development with a particular interest in CSS. The approach 
			taken by Foamy Panda Creations is that of minimalism. The fewer items displayed on a web page the better.
			Foamy Panda Creations also pride themselves in using as few pages for a site as possible, instead using 
			JavaScript to dynamically change the content of a web page to display additional information.
